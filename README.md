## 📡 API Documentation

The API follows RESTful principles with the following main endpoints:

- `/api/courses` - Course management endpoints
- `/api/chapters` - Chapter and content management
- `/api/uploadthing` - File upload endpoints
- `/api/webhook` - Stripe webhook endpoint

We provide comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. Access the interactive API documentation by navigating to `/api-docs` in your browser when the application is running.

### Generating API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated from JSDoc annotations in the API routes. To update or regenerate the documentation:

```bash
# Generate API documentation
pnpm generate-api-docs
```

For more information on how the API documentation is implemented, refer to the [API Documentation](docs/improvements/api-documentation.md) guide.

## Real-time Collaboration Features

The application now includes real-time collaboration features powered by Pusher:

1. **Real-time Comments** - Comments appear immediately for all users without the need to refresh. This includes:
   - New comments and replies
   - Comment updates
   - Comment deletions

2. **User Presence** - Shows who's currently viewing a chapter, allowing users to see who else is online.

3. **Typing Indicators** - Displays when other users are typing in the comment section, creating a more interactive discussion environment.

### Setting Up Pusher

To use these real-time features, you need to set up a Pusher account:

1. Create an account on [Pusher.com](https://pusher.com/) and create a new "Channels" app
2. Add your Pusher credentials to the `.env` file:

```env
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
```

### Real-time Architecture

- **Server-side Events** - API endpoints trigger Pusher events after database operations
- **Client-side Subscriptions** - Components subscribe to relevant channels and update the UI in real-time
- **Private & Presence Channels** - Used for secure user-specific features like typing indicators and presence
