- [ ] Double-tap zoom is prevented where appropriate
- [ ] Form inputs can be easily selected and typed into
- [ ] Keyboard appears properly when tapping form inputs
- [ ] Focus states are visible when navigating forms
- [ ] Touch gestures work as expected

## Content Behaviors

- [ ] Text remains readable at all viewport sizes
- [ ] Line lengths remain comfortable for reading
- [ ] Images scale proportionally without distortion
- [ ] No text is truncated inappropriately

- [ ] Horizontal scrolling is avoided (except for appropriate elements like tables)

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Page load times are reasonable on mobile networks
- [ ] Interactions remain smooth on mobile devices
- [ ] No unnecessary content is loaded on mobile
- [ ] Animations are not choppy on mobile devices
- [ ] Motion effects respect prefers-reduced-motion settings

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Content maintains sufficient color contrast on all screen sizes
- [ ] Text is zoomable without breaking layouts
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible when using keyboard navigation
- [ ] Elements maintain proper tab order on all devices

## Specific Feature Tests

- [ ] Search functionality works properly on mobile

- [ ] User profile actions work on mobile

## Regression Testing

- [ ] Existing desktop functionality remains intact
- [ ] No new issues introduced on desktop layouts
- [ ] Features work consistently across all breakpoints
- [ ] Switching between orientations doesn't break layouts

## Final Verification

- [ ] All viewports render without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Content is readable without zooming on mobile
- [ ] Interactive elements are usable with touch input
- [ ] All breakpoints transition smoothly

## Notes

- Document specific issues discovered during testing
- Note any device-specific behaviors that need addressing
